# ppProject

Description: We'll build an application that takes the output files of three Copy Number Value(CNV) caller tools - readDepth, SVdetect and CNVnator(this one can be optional), and, based on some well defined rules, we'll combine those files in order to have a better prediction of the CNVs. Also if the user has a file which contains a reference genome, the app can also merge the output with the reference genome file.
